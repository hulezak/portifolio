        <h2>Older Racism</h2>
        <p>
          Past racism refers to historical instances of discrimination and
          prejudice based on race. It encompassed various forms such as slavery,
          segregation, and systemic bias. These practices created significant
          barriers and hardships for marginalized communities, perpetuating
          inequality and social injustice.

        <h2>Future Racism and AI</h2>
        <p>
          The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) brings new challenges in
          the fight against racism.

          I apologize for the length. Here's a shorter version of the paragraph:
          "MIT Media Lab researcher Joy Buolamwini uncovered a disconcerting
          reality while working with facial recognition software. She discovered
          that the algorithm failed to recognize her own face until she wore a
          white mask. This revelation exposed the prevalence of racial biases in
          AI systems. Buolamwini's groundbreaking work on racial and gender
          biases, including the concept of 'white mask girls,' has brought
          attention to the discriminatory nature of these technologies. Her
          research serves as a stark reminder of the potential future racism
          faced by individuals like her if biases are not addressed in emerging
          technologies."
